		Chance the rappers Debut Mix Tape '10Day' was inspired by a 10 day suspension he received 
		for the possession of marijuana on school campus. The album beautifully describes Chances experiences 
		as a teenager growing up in Chicago. The mix tape has heavy influences from many popular rappers from the 90's
		as well as strong gospel influences.

	<br />
	<p class="tab">
		Chance's second mix tape, Acid Rap, came only a year and one month after the release of 10Day. The tone of this mix tape
		differs drastically from 10Day in that many of the songs are about much more mature subjects. Chance tackles subjects such as gang violence, 
		media indifference towards the black community, drug abuse as well as exploring the concepts of love and family with a much more mature outlook.
	</p>	
	<br />
	<p class="tab">
		Finally, Chances most recent mix tape, Colouring Book, released 3 years after acid rap, incorporates much more gospel influences than his original work 10Day.
		The tone of this mix tape is cheery and optimistic, giving the listener the impression that Chance is much more adult and able to retell stories 
		and experiences from his child hood with better understanding.
