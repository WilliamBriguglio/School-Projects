The code in these projects were not dont entirely by me. 
The teacher provided us with the skeleton of the programs and we were to fill in the correct code to make the program work as desired. 
In the case of the final project much of the code, over 50%, was not written by me, HOWEVER, for all projects we were expected to have a complete understanding of the code used.
